# Code-first using APIFlask

This is an example of using annotations in Python code - also known as "code-first design" - to generate an OpenAPI description.

## Pre-requisites

This is a Python application. You'll need Python 3 available, ideally at 3.12 or above with `virtualenv` and `pip` installed.

## Installation

First up you'll need to create a virtual environment and then activate it. Use your favorite environment manager like `pyenv`, or use the following boilerplate commands (assuming you are in this directory already):

```bash
virtualenv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

With your fresh environment activated, you can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
